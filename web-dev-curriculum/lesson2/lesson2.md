> In the creative tech studio we aim to provide you with the  knowledge, resources, and skills in basic coding languages as well as an understanding of programming and its uses.

## üèÜ <spam style = "color:gold"> **Goals:** </span>
- learn basic HTML tags (H1, H2, H3, p, li, ul, img, src, href)
- earn how to connect css files and manipulate styling (classes/ names)

**These 3 languages are key for Web Developers:**

- <span style = "color:orange"> **HTML** </span> to define the content of web pages
- <span style = "color:lightblue">**CSS** </span>to specify the layout of web pages
- <span style = "color:red">**JavaScript** </span>to program the behavior of web pages

<br/>

## **Today we will be focusing on <span style = "color:orange"> HTML</span> and <span style = "color:lightblue"> CSS </span> :**

<br/>

> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and is the standard markup language used to crete website
 We use **Tags** to describe the elements of the page

#### Some of the most common tags include:

- The ` body `  body tag is used to encompass most content in the HTML file 
- The `title` tag refrs to a title 
- The `p` tag refers to "paragraph" and is used to hold any long piece of text 
- The `H1` tag refers to Header 1, the `H2` tag refers to Header 2, and finally `H3` tag refers to Header 3. These are often used to style your text into various headers and subheaders depending on the developers needs
-  The `link` tag refers to a external site
- The `image` tag allows you to add images to your site, it's often used with the `src` attribute to find the imga ein your project 
- The `li` and `ul` tags allow you to make list an dunordered list. This is good to ctreat bullets within your site listing out information
- lasty we have the `href` attribute that allows you to link elements of your site to other pages on your own site as well as other websites on the internet


#### Every one of these must be used with an "opening" and "closing" tag. These are made with the `<` (greater than) and `>` (less than symbols). The "closing" tag uses a `/` (slash) charcter as well.

> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media

To use CSS you need a **selector** and **declaration**, a declaration is usally made up of **property** and a **value**. Say you want to edit your H1 tag and make it big and red. Your selector would be `h1` and the declaration would be "making it red". This can be done using the property of `color` and giving it the value of `red`

The syntax would look something like this...
~~~

<H1> This is my H1 </H1>

<style>

h1 {
    color:red
}

</style>

~~~

You can add inline styles like we see above where house all our styles in between two style tags. But this can make a file super long and hard to read/navigate. 
It's best practice to separate your styling into a separate file usally called something like **styles.css**

These two files need to be bale to communicate so we use 

In the **Lesson 2** folder open up <span style="color:orange"> **lesson2pt2** </span> and <span style="color:lightblue"> **lesson2.css** </span>  side by side, see if you can tell what each element might look like based on the styles

##  Open up <span style= "color:orange"> **lesson2pt2.html** </span> and click the "Go Live" button on the bottom right of your VS code, see how <span style= "color:lightblue"> **lesson2.css** </span> effects the page
