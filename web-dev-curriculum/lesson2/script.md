# In the creative tech studio we aim to provide you with knowledge, resources, and skills in basic coding languages as well as an understanding of programming and its uses.

## üèÜ Goals:
- learn basic HTML tags (H1, H2, H3, p, li, ul, img, src, href)
- earn how to connect css files and manipulate styling (classes/ names)

## These 3 languages are key for Web Developers:

- **HTML** to define the content of web pages
- **CSS** to specify the layout of web pages
- **JavaScript** to program the behavior of web pages

## Today we will be focusing on HTML

### HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and is the standard markup language used to crete website
### We use **Tags** to describe the elements of the page

### Some of the most common tags include:

- The <code> body tag is used to encompass most content in the HTML file 
- The <title>
- The <p> tag refers to "paragraph" and is used to hold any long piece of text 
- The <H1> tag refers to Header 1, the <H2> tag refers to Header 2, and finally <H3> tag refers to Header 3. These are often used to style your text into various headers and subheaders depending on the developers needs
-  The <link> tag refers to a external site

### every one of these must be used with an "opening" and "closing" tag

### ex: <body> my content </body>
