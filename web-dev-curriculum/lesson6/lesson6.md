# üóÇ Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Create a new folder in the lesson 6 folder name it the title of your portfolio. Inside the folder, create two new files: index.html, styles.css, scripts.js

#  üß± Step 2: HTML Structure
In your index.html file, paste the following code:

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Personality Quiz</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    
    <!-- import the webpage's stylesheet -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">
    
    
    <!-- import the webpage's javascript file -->
    <script src="/script.js" defer></script>
  </head>  
  <body>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  
    <h2>Question 1:</h2>
    <div class="question">
      <div class="answer-choice">
        <button id="q1a1">answer1</button>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-choice">
        <button id="q1a2">answer 2</button>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-choice">
        <button id="q1a3">answer 3</button>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-choice">
        <button id="q1a4">answer 4</button>
      </div>
    </div> 
    
    
    <div class="result">
      <h3 id="result"></h3>
    </div>
    
    <div class="restart">
      <button id="restart">Take It Again</button>
    </div>

  </body>
</html>


```



# üé® Step 3: Styling Your Website

Now that we have our HTML structure set up, we can add some styling to our website. Open your style.css file and add the following code:


``` css

/* CSS files add styling rules to your content */

body {
  background: gray;
  margin: 2em;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

h1 { 

}

h2 { 

}
 
/* answers */
h3 { 

}



/* makes sure images are all the same size */
img {

}


.question {

}

.answer-choice { 

}


/* Button Styles */
button{}

.restart {

}


```

# ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Adding Functionaility

Now that we have our HTML and CSS set up, we can add some functionaility to our website. Open your scripts.js file and add the following code:


``` javascript

// Create four variables to track each possible quiz outcome
var questionCount = 0;

var result_1_score = 0;
var result_2_score = 0;
var result_3_score = 0;
var result_4_score = 0;

//grab result via DOM
var result = document.getElementById("result");
var resultpic = document.getElementById("resultpic");

//create variables
//question 1
var q1a1 = document.getElementById("q1a1");
var q1a2 = document.getElementById("q1a2");
var q1a3 = document.getElementById("q1a3");
var q1a4 = document.getElementById("q1a4");


```

You'll find exmaples from your mentors in the folder with their names (also located in the lesson 3 folder)
- to access them open up the folder with the person's name
- naviagate to the HTML file within the folder
- click the go live button

‚≠êÔ∏è Hint: You'll find some intersting functionality and features in these you may want to try and add to your own site
